Check the effect in the colocking time when temperture change


Post Lab
-------------------------------------------------
1.What is the time delay you have measure don the oscilloscope at indoor and outdoor temperature ? What is their percentage of error?

Unless it is very colder than the timer tolrence the percentage rafelly around 3 percent.

2.Is it possible to use the SysTick timer to generate an interrupt once every 100 seconds if there is only a clock 2.097 MHz?If not, what solutions could we have? If yes, how to set up the SysTick_LOAD register?

It is possaplbe but need to loop the timer instade of pass imidite value. The prescale value has limit upper scale but still can be complish by repate the prosses to the desire timing.

Academic Dishonesty
-------------------------------------------------
Academic dishonesty includes cheating, plagiarism
and all forms of misrepresentation in academic work, 
and is unacceptable at The University of Maine. As 
stated in the University of Maine's online 
undergraduate "Student Handbook," plagiarism 
(the submission of another's work without appropriate 
attribution) and cheating are violations of The 
University of Maine Student Conduct Code. An 
instructor who has probable cause or reason to 
believe a student has cheated may act upon such evidence, 
and should report the case to the supervising faculty 
member or the Department Chair for appropriate action.
