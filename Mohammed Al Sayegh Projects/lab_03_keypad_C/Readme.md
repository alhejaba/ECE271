In this lab we configure the setting for keypad


Something Cool Implemented in This Lab

Sugguestions for This Lab

-------------------------------------------------

1. When multiple keys are pressed, can the scan algorithm correctly detect all keys pressed? 
(Hint: ghosting, or ghost key)

It depend logically it will scan keys in sequence so it will print it in a sequence of scan logarithim

2.What suggestions you would give to improve the experiences of this lab?
Put an array example that represent different parts of GPIO which make it easy to configure and easy to read the code later

3.For the textbook, do you find any typos or have any comments or suggestions
no


Typos, Errors, or Comments of The Textbook

No

Lab Credit
-------------------------------------------------

Did you received any help from someone other than 
Professor Zhu and lab assistants?
Nothing involved the code


Academic Dishonesty
-------------------------------------------------


Academic dishonesty includes cheating, plagiarism
and all forms of misrepresentation in academic work, 

and is unacceptable at The University of Maine. As 
stated in the University of Maine's online 
undergraduate "Student Handbook,"
 plagiarism 
(the submission of another's work without appropriate 
attribution) and cheating are violations of The 
University of Maine Student 
Conduct Code. An 
instructor who has probable cause or reason to 
believe a student has cheated may act upon such evidence, 
and should report 
the case to the supervising faculty 
member or the Department Chair for appropriate action.
