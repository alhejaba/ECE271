Academic Dishonesty
-------------------------------------------------
Academic dishonesty includes cheating, plagiarism and all forms of misrepresentation in academic work,  and is unacceptable at The University of Maine. As stated in the University of Maine's online undergraduate "Student Handbook," plagiarism  (the submission of another's work without appropriate  attribution) and cheating are violations of The University of Maine Student Conduct Code. An instructor who has probable cause or reason to believe a student has cheated may act upon such evidence, and should report the case to the supervising faculty 
member or the Department Chair for appropriate action.
